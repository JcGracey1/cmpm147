				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I was to create my own variation of a grammar-based text generation method.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Based on the template we were given, I changed the categories of the fillers
					to fit the theme of my generator. I wanted mutliple selections to be made
					from some of the same categories, but I don't know how to check if one had
					already been selected or not as to avoid repeats. To combat this problem,
					I simply split the categories into two and used one filler from each.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Since I have practically no experience in JavaScript, this experiment made for a good intro.
					Changing the generator itself posed little challenge, but I did have difficulties importing
					it over from glitch and getting it to work within this website.

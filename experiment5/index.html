				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project reads in a few different artistic images, renders parameterized images, and adjusts its own designs to optimize an evaluation score.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Starting with base project that we were given, I added my own images that I thought would yield unique mutations. I added a new option menu into the html and added a listener so that I could change the muations based on what is slectected. The first two shapes are basic: ellipse and rectangle, but I wanted to add something to spice it up. The thirs shape is basically a distorted ellipse ny using sine and cosine waves, I'm really happy with how it turned out visually.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I tried working with a partner in this project and I think given the revision of this assignment coming out late and us not knowing really whats going on led to not the best collaborative work. Instead of working simultaneously we each did work and then would chat about what we did. This is my first time trying to work with someone so it was definately good to see how we might change things for the future. Other than that, to me this assignment was more about creating something visually appealing that it was about the technicalities of it, which was fun.</p>

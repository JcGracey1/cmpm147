				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is my second world out of the three generated worlds. In this one my goal was to replicate an infinite ocean with an intereactive element, which is a riple effect starting from the tile that was clicked.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Starting with base world that we were given, I then chose different two different colors that I wanted to represent the light and dark spots in an ocean. In order to create a gradient between the the light and dark spots, I used a noise value to ensure that adjacent tiles will likely have similar but slightly varied brightness values. For my thrid world I used a similar tactic but changed the context of the world as well as the interactive element.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I think this was a good lesson for my to not try anything too crazy in my first go-around, because it really demotivated me. Instead I think its better to implement something simple first, or to pivot if one idea is taking too long. That was my main issue with this project and although I didn't get to spend as much time on my other two worlds, I am happy with how they tunred out. </p>

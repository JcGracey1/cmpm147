				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I am trying to replicate, a simplified version, of my chosen landscape procedurally. I gathered inspiration from two images, one of a desert oasis, and the other of a Hawaiian sunset. If you look at both the pictures and my creation, you will see the influence from both.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>First, I started with a simple backbround, a sky and horizon that rises about 1/3 of the way up the canvas, I did this by using fill and rect. Next, similarly to what was done in the example, I added "steps" to give the horizon some texture that represents dunes. With the help of ChatGPT, I added two similar functions: one to represent the clouds, and one for the top of the trees. Since I wanted a palm tree look, I knew that it would be more complex than a simple triangle. The leaves are similar to an ellipse bit with random amounts of squiggle with a mex height and width.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was a fun and meticulous experiemnt. In order to get things working and understanding what my code does, I spent a lot of time tweaking differnet values and then watching what it did to my design. I'm not used to "drawing" in this type of environment, so it was hard going against what I thought the values would be intuitively.</p>
